					<description><![CDATA[Great summary!  Thank you.

//quote
Where do you put your encryption key? Some common choices:
In the database - BAD
On the file system - BAD
In an application config file - BAD
//endquote

Could you add &quot;As an environment variable&quot; to this list?  So I can have a clear reference to counter the mid-level developers who think they&#039;re smarter than a good hacker?  And maybe &quot;java system properties&quot;?

I continue to see these used for the encryption-key.  And, similar to you, label this as &quot;hiding the key to your house under the doormat, or probably better, hanging the key to your house on the front door&quot;.

thanks again]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yaron,

Thanks for the post. I&#039;m using a form of AES, but wondering which encryption mode to choose. I&#039;m leaning toward OFB, because I&#039;ve been told by other network engineers that it takes up less space, which corroborates some of the answers in that Stack Overflow post you linked to. However, OCB also looks appealing though it appears to be protected by patents (?). Which do you prefer? 

Kindly,
L]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sunil,
QKD helps distribute a *shared* key between *two* parties such that anyone else listening will be detected immediately. The drawbacks are that they are point-to-point links versus hub-and-spoke. So for N entities, you need N(N-1)/2 QKD links which becomes unmanageable exponentially. Also link lengths are typically limited to just a few hundred kilometers, limiting their geographic reach. Lastly, to distribute a *public* key (as you asked) you can do that over a public channel. No need for quantum anything. I hope that&#039;s helpful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yaron 

A great article with very apt information.  Curious to know whether you have explored the merit of using &quot;Quantum Key Distribution&quot; to distribute public keys as photons in an absolutely unhackable way.  

Thanks

I have a question about this post. I am making an essay and I want to use this. But I need to give your name and the publishing date. Can you please give me the year in which you wrote this article?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure Joel. First - the mandatory warning ;)  ... we caution that until you&#039;ve mastered the materials and have experimented by implemented a few security platforms, do not implement one for production use, securing data of any value. This is because there are many subtle things that weaken security. Simplified example: using an equality comparator (==) instead of a constant-time equality comparator (custom implementation) can weaken good cryptography. There are many other cases and you&#039;re aware of all these only with sufficient mastery and experience. Even then implementations can have issues, requiring ongoing updates. (e.g. OpenSSL and Heartbleed). 

With that disclaimer, here are some books, in order of recommendation:

1) Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
2) Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson &amp; Schneier
3) Cryptography and Network Security by William Stallings

If you&#039;ve been put off by dense Math equations before, note that mathematical intuition can often take you far in understanding existing ciphers. Of course, when creating ciphers and proving their security, one does need deep math expertise and solid current experience. Happy reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Do you know of any good, comprehensive books on encryption that would contain the information you&#039;ve provided? I essentially want to learn how to implement encryption properly to secure data.

Thank you!

					<description><![CDATA[Great read, but one suggestion.  You failed to mention FPE or format preserving encryption.  Using FPE,  you can encrypt sensitive information, even while in use.  So even a user that presented valid credentials would only see protected data.     

This is the future of encryption.   It allows for the adoption of a &quot;least privilege&quot; model.  While not all data can be protected this way, the sensitive information (the stuff you read about being stolen) can be.  Data at Rest is still important but you said it yourself,  the chances of disk or complete array walking out of your data center are limited.]]></description>
